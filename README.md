# Welcome to my Github!

## Wait, where am I?

You've reached the Github of @LewisHawkins.

## Who are you?
  
I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton in the UK. I'm usually listening to music.

## Aaaaand what do you have to offer?

A lot of my repositories are related to uni work, but there's probably some fun side projects and Capture The Flag (CTF) writeups here too.

## Cheers!

No problem :)
